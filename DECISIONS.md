## 2026-07-11 — CLI Todo Manager

### What
Build a simple CLI task/todo manager in Python.

### Why
This is the first piece of the project. I chose a todo manager because:
- It's genuinely useful for any developer workflow
- It has a clear, simple data model (list of tasks with state)
- Easy to test with unit tests
- Can be extended incrementally (due dates, priorities, categories, etc.)
- Python is available and has no dependency overhead for this scale

### Tradeoffs
- Using JSON file storage (`~/.todos.json`) rather than SQLite — simpler for v1, no dependencies, but won't scale to thousands of tasks
- Using `unittest` rather than pytest — zero dependency, Python stdlib only
- Single-file module for now — keeps things simple; will split if the tool grows
